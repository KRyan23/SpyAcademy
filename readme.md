### Testing User Stories from User Experience Section

### Users Stories
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand what the main purpose of the site is.

        1. Upon landing on the main page users are greeted with a clean site which conveys the message that you are entering a game.
        2. On clicking the 'Enter Game' button the site further reinforces the message of its purpose by describing the purpose of the site and reinforcing the point using the '3' Spy Badge Imagery that appears throughout the game.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I would like to try out the games easily to see if I am interested..

        1. The site has been designed to give a good and unimpeded flow from start to end.
        2. At any stage through each game the user has the opportunity to click the abort button which will bring them back to the index page.


    3. As a First Time Visitor, I would like to try out the game as a parent to see if it is appropriate for my child.

        1. Any Adult can play the game at each of the difficulty levels, but if you want to choose the hardest level then they can choose age 16.
        2. The site does not require you to 'sign up' or login to use the games so a parent can quickly try out the site and decide if its suitible with minimal effort.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I would like an easy way to get in touch since I would like more information about the sites content.

        1. Since the layout of the game is not a traditional webpage there is no contact information, so the user is directed to the social media links in order to get in touch.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to pick up where I left off even if I havent passed all 3 games.
        1. The game uses localStorage to hold progress information if the user exits out of the game so they can close the browser and still pickup where they left off from before.
        2. The exception to this rule is the user hits the 'Abort' key at any stage, this will deliberatly clear the localStorage associated with game progress.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to share my best times and scores with other users of the game while also picking up any tips on passing a difficult level.

        1. The best way for the user got about this is by tweeting to a dedicated channel, or joining one of the many Facebook groups setup for this game.
        They can use the social media links at the bottom of the page to acheive this.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I would like to check their social media pages for any updates to the game.

        1. As with any new service or product and prior to launch there would be dedicated social media channels setup specifically to allow their users to easily interact.
        2. Users can just launch the dedicatted social media channels from the links provided.
  2. As a Frequent younger user, I dont have a social media account and would just like to play the games without any restrictions.
        1. The site itself does not hold a database of users or require login to use its services so there is unrestricted access at all times.
