## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

#### Business Goals
* The Business already has an existing website called Spy Academy but the design lacks interactivity. Rather than redesigning the whole site the customer is looking to add the game to improve is customer experience.
* The Spy Academy website is the front end to a businees that runs a 2hr Spy Academy where kids solve problems, crack codes and learn what its like to be a 'real spy' earning points along the way with a goal to graduate from the Spy Academy.
* The addition of the game to the main website is to give customers a flavour of what to expect from the onsite activity.
* Between the customer and the developer it has been decided that the game was the best way to drive sales with possiblly sending the user a discount code by email if they complete the 3 challenges on-line.

#### User Goals
